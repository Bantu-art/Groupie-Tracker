    ```bash
   http://localhost:9000
    ```

## Implementation Details

### Endpoints

- **GET /**: Serves the main page where users can see the landing page of our project.

- **GET /artists**: Displays a list of all available artists, allowing users to click on an artist to view more details.

- **GET /artists/{id}**: Serves a detailed page for a specific artist, including information about the artist's members, first album, and a list of concert dates and locations.

- **GET /search**: Allows users to search for artists based on their name or other attributes.


### Features

- **Artist Listing**: Users can browse a list of artists, each with a brief overview including the name and an image.

- **Artist Details**: Clicking on an artist's name takes users to a detailed page with information about the artist, such as the members, first album, and a list of concert dates and locations.

- **Concerts Overview**: Users can view a list of concert locations and dates for each artist, giving them a comprehensive look at where and when the artist has performed.

- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring that users can easily navigate and view artist information on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Error Handling**: Users are presented with appropriate error messages if they attempt to access invalid artist URLs or if there is an issue retrieving artist data from the API.


  ### Algorithm

The Groupie Tracker project involves several key steps to retrieve and display artist information and concert details from an external API. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Receiving User Request**:
   - The main page (`GET /`) allows users to view a list of available artists. Each artist's name is linked to a detailed view.
   - When a user clicks on an artist's name, a `GET` request is sent to the `/artists/{id}` endpoint to fetch detailed information about that specific artist.

2. **Processing the URL**:
   - The server extracts the artist's ID from the URL path. This ID is then used to construct API requests to fetch the artist's details and related concert information.

3. **Fetching Artist Information**:
   - The server sends an API request to an external service (e.g., `https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/artists/{id}`) to retrieve the artist's detailed information, including name, image, first album, and members.
   - If the artist is found, the server processes the JSON response into Go structs that represent the artist's data.

4. **Fetching Concert Information**:
   - The server makes another API request to fetch the concert locations and dates associated with the artist (e.g., `https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/relation/{id}`).
   - This data is then processed into a map structure, where keys are locations, and values are slices of dates.

5. **Combining Data for Display**:
   - The artist information and concert data are combined into a single template data structure.
   - The server uses Go templates to render the artist's detail page, embedding the artist's information and a list of concerts into the HTML.

6. **Displaying the Result**:
   - The server returns the rendered HTML page, displaying the artist's name, image, first album, members, and a list of concert locations and dates.
   - Users can view this detailed information directly in their browser.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - The server checks for potential errors throughout the process, such as invalid artist IDs, missing data, or API request failures.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., the artist ID does not exist), the server responds with an appropriate error message, such as `404 Not Found` or `500 Internal Server Error`.


## HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Returned when the artist details and concert information are successfully retrieved and displayed.
- `404 Not Found`: Returned when a requested artist ID does not exist or when a non-existent page or resource is accessed.
- `400 Bad Request`: Returned when the client sends an invalid request, such as an incorrect URL format.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Returned when the server encounters an unexpected error while processing the request, such as a failure to retrieve data from the external API.


### Technologies Used

- **Go**: The primary programming language used to build the server-side logic, manage routes, and handle API interactions.
- **HTML Templates**: Utilized for rendering dynamic content on the web pages, including artist details and concert information.
- **Net/HTTP Package**: Employed for handling HTTP requests and responses, enabling communication between the client and server.
- **JSON**: Used for data interchange between the server and the Groupie Trackers API, allowing the application to fetch and display artist and concert information.
